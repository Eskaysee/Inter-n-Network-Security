The tests are in the src folder not tests. The make file can be used to compile all code
and to run the client side  ("make Client"). The Server must be running first. The Server
and Test class will need an IDE to run. The Certificate Authorities server address will need 
to be adjust to the ip of whereever the server is being run (Client class line 113). If the 
user wishes, the other clients hostname/ip address can be changed from localhost (Client class
line 748)
